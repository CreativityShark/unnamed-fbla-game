All you need to do is make it through our obstacle course up to the [b]third floor[/b] to claim your new position.

Obstacle course?
Management

Yes! As part of our proprietary onboarding process, applicants must complete our obstacle course to gauge their physical fitness. If you would, please head to the door at your left to continue.
